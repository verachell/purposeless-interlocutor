# Purposeless Interlocutor

tiny single page demo application in ruby on rails using hotwire turbo frames

## What it does
The name says it all: provides pointless responses to status updates

Most of the logic is located in the comments controller at `app/controllers/comments_controller.rb`

## How to use it
Assuming you already have Ruby and rails installed on your local machine, download the main branch of this repo and in the working directory, type `rails server` then in your browser navigate to `localhost:3000`

This is also available deployed to Render but I'm not publicly sharing the URL here for several reasons, including that I won't have it running continuously. The `deploy-render` branch reflects the Render-ready version

### Ruby and rails versions
This rails app was developed in a Linux environment using Ruby v 3.3.0 and rails v 7.1.3.2
