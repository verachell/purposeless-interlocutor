# Purposeless Interlocutor

tiny single page demo application in ruby on rails using hotwire turbo frames

## What it does
The name says it all: provides pointless responses to status updates

Most of the logic is located in the comments controller at `app/controllers/comments_controller.rb`

## How to use it
This branch is the Render-ready version; it likely won't work out of the box if you try to run it on your local machine. If that's what you want to do, use the `main` branch of this repo instead
 
### Ruby and rails versions
This rails app was developed in a Linux environment using Ruby v 3.3.0 and rails v 7.1.3.2
